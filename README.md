#Epic Plugin for NPTool V4

**Epic** is a plugin for **NPTool V4**, inspired by the fission chamber plugin but introducing flexible features.  

## Features

- No hard-coded values — fully configurable.  
- Set the number of fission chambers.  
- Set the number of anodes per chamber.  
- Support for multi-body fission chambers.  
- Anode distances are dynamically read (depending on grounding; may vary between experiments).  
- One sample per event is saved — specifically, the anode with the maximum signal.  

## Namespace

All classes are contained in the `epic` namespace:

```cpp
namespace epic {
    class EpicData {};
    class EpicPhysics {};
    class EpicSpectra {};
    class EpicGeant4 {};
}
```

## Installation

For installation of NPTool V4:

# This will
# - install the epic plugin in ~/.local/nptool/default/
# - copy all EpicXXX.h in ~/.local/nptool/default/include/ 
```

## Create and manage your project with the EPIC plugin

To create your project:
[Project Management](https://nptool.in2p3.fr/manual-v4/project-management/)
```bash
cd /folder/of/your/nptoolV4/projects/
nptool --new-project EPICproject
# This will
# - update the project.list in ~/.local/nptool/default/
# - create the folder EPICproject in /folder/of/your/nptoolV4/projects/
```

In your project folder, configuration files must be added:
```bash
detector/detector.yaml
configEPIC.dat
```

To compile, in your project folder:
```bash
mkdir build install
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install ./
make -C build/ install
```
